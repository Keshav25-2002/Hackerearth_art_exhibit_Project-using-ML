# Hackerearth_art_exhibit_Project-using-ML

AIM: 

This project aims to predict the type of art exhibit based on the features of the artwork using Machine Learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is 

provided by HackerEarth.

Dataset

The dataset contains a total of 16,174 observations and 19 features. The target variable is the type of art exhibit, which is to be predicted based on the features of 

the artwork.

Model

The Hackerearth Art Exhibit Project using ML is built using Python, and the model is built using various Machine Learning algorithms like Random Forest, KNN, and 

Logistic Regression. The project is divided into three parts: data preprocessing, model building, and model evaluation. In the data preprocessing part, the dataset is 

preprocessed and transformed into the required format for the modeling part. In the model building part, the various algorithms are trained on the preprocessed dataset 

to predict the type of art exhibit. Finally, in the model evaluation part, the performance of each algorithm is evaluated based on various metrics like accuracy, 

precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning algorithms can be used to predict the type of art exhibit based on the features of the artwork. The project showcases 

how to preprocess the dataset and transform it into the required format for the modeling part. The results of this analysis can be used by art galleries and museums to 

better understand their audience and create exhibits that cater to their interests.
